# Contributing Guidelines

The project is now at the initial development stage. This means, I'm open to any suggestions about the interface, performance, included methods, etc. 

If you want to add new functionality or method, feel free to just make a PR. If you want to change some interface, e.g., pass a list of images instead of path to a video file, please create the issue.
